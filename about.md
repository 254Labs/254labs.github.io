254 Labs is an open, independent and multi-disciplinary research and engineering organisation for web security. Founded by [@genuinemoses](https://genuinemoses.github.io/) in 2022, with a strong opinion for free-knowledge and free-software.

Thus, you find us mostly emphasizing and publishing our research work from the blended world of web security, application security, security engineering and software enginnering along with other horizontal and vertical disciplines, wherever and whenever applicable.

We also love contributing to open-source space and building open-source community, technologies, tools and processes.

Peace and Cheers!
